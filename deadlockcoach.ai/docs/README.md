# DeadlockCoach.gg Documentation

## Overview

This documentation covers the comprehensive analysis for scaling DeadlockCoach.gg from 10 users to 1 million users using a React frontend, Haskell backend with WAI server, PostgreSQL database, and on-server LLM models.

## Document Structure

### üìä [Scaling Analysis](./risk-assessment/scaling-analysis.md)
Comprehensive analysis of scaling from 10 to 1 million users across 6 distinct tiers, including:
- Infrastructure requirements for each tier
- Cost projections and risk assessments
- Technology-specific considerations for Haskell, PostgreSQL, and LLM serving
- Timeline and performance targets

### üèóÔ∏è [System Architecture](./architecture/system-design.md)
Detailed technical architecture including:
- High-level system design with component interactions
- Database schema and API design
- LLM integration strategies and computer vision pipeline
- Security, performance optimization, and deployment strategies

### üí∞ [Cost Breakdown](./scaling/cost-breakdown.md)
Detailed financial analysis covering:
- Tier-by-tier cost breakdowns from $34/month to $75,000/month
- LLM inference cost deep dive with token usage estimates
- Revenue model recommendations and conversion assumptions
- Unit economics and break-even analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è [Technical Risk Assessment](./risk-assessment/technical-risks.md)
Comprehensive risk analysis including:
- Infrastructure and scaling risks with mitigation strategies
- Haskell-specific technical challenges and solutions
- AI/ML model risks and monitoring approaches
- Security, performance, and reliability considerations

## Key Findings Summary

### Cost Evolution
- **10 users**: $34/month
- **100 users**: $116/month  
- **1,000 users**: $536/month
- **10,000 users**: $4,252/month
- **100,000 users**: $15,250/month
- **1,000,000 users**: $75,000/month

### Critical Success Factors
1. **LLM Cost Management**: Represents 30-40% of total costs at scale
2. **Database Scaling**: Plan sharding strategy early (Tier 4+)
3. **Haskell Expertise**: Build team capabilities gradually
4. **Revenue Conversion**: Target 5% freemium conversion rate

### Major Risk Areas
1. **Technical**: Memory leaks, database bottlenecks, model accuracy
2. **Operational**: Limited Haskell talent pool, infrastructure complexity
3. **Financial**: LLM inference cost spikes, low conversion rates
4. **Security**: Data privacy, API vulnerabilities, compliance

### Recommended Approach
- Start with Tier 1 MVP for validation
- Scale incrementally with 30% monthly growth targets
- Invest in monitoring and automation early
- Plan for multi-region deployment at Tier 5

## Technology Stack Justification

### React Frontend
- ‚úÖ Large talent pool and ecosystem
- ‚úÖ Excellent user experience capabilities
- ‚úÖ Strong community and tooling support

### Haskell Backend
- ‚úÖ Excellent concurrency and performance
- ‚úÖ Type safety reduces runtime errors
- ‚úÖ Efficient memory usage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited talent pool
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Smaller ecosystem

### PostgreSQL Database
- ‚úÖ ACID compliance and reliability
- ‚úÖ Excellent scaling options
- ‚úÖ Rich feature set and extensions
- ‚úÖ Strong community support

### Local LLM Models
- ‚úÖ Cost control and data privacy
- ‚úÖ Customization capabilities
- ‚úÖ No external API dependencies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Infrastructure complexity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Model management overhead

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Month 1)**:
   - Implement Tier 1 infrastructure
   - Set up basic monitoring
   - Create MVP with core features

2. **Short-term (Months 2-6)**:
   - User validation and feedback
   - Performance optimization
   - Security hardening

3. **Medium-term (Months 7-18)**:
   - Scale to Tier 3
   - Implement advanced features
   - Build team capabilities

4. **Long-term (Years 2-5)**:
   - Enterprise scaling
   - Global deployment
   - Advanced AI capabilities
