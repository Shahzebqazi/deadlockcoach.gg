## Technology-Specific Considerations

### Haskell WAI Server Scaling
**Advantages:**
- Excellent concurrent performance with lightweight threads
- Strong type safety reduces runtime errors
- Efficient memory usage
- Good performance characteristics

**Challenges:**
- Smaller talent pool for hiring
- Fewer third-party libraries
- Learning curve for team members
- Limited cloud-native tooling

**Scaling Strategies:**
- Use STM for concurrent state management
- Implement connection pooling for PostgreSQL
- Leverage Haskell's lazy evaluation for memory efficiency
- Consider GHC runtime tuning for large heaps

### PostgreSQL Scaling Path
1. **Single instance** (Tier 1-2)
2. **Master-slave replication** (Tier 3)
3. **Read replicas + connection pooling** (Tier 4)
4. **Horizontal sharding** (Tier 5)
5. **Distributed PostgreSQL (Citus/Postgres-XL)** (Tier 6)

### LLM Model Serving Evolution
1. **Single model on CPU** (Tier 1-2)
2. **Multiple models, CPU inference** (Tier 3)
3. **GPU acceleration, model caching** (Tier 4)
4. **Distributed inference, model optimization** (Tier 5)
5. **Edge deployment, custom silicon** (Tier 6)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Single Point of Failure**: Implement redundancy at each tier
- **Database Bottlenecks**: Plan sharding strategy early
- **LLM Inference Costs**: Optimize models, implement caching
- **Memory Leaks**: Comprehensive monitoring and profiling

### Business Risks
- **Scaling Costs**: Implement usage-based pricing
- **Competition**: Focus on unique AI capabilities
- **Regulatory**: Plan for data privacy compliance
- **Talent**: Build Haskell expertise gradually

### Operational Risks
- **Deployment Complexity**: Invest in CI/CD early
- **Monitoring Gaps**: Implement comprehensive observability
- **Security**: Regular security audits and updates
- **Data Loss**: Robust backup and disaster recovery

## Recommended Scaling Timeline

**Months 1-3**: Tier 1 (MVP validation)
**Months 4-9**: Tier 2 (Early user feedback)
**Months 10-18**: Tier 3 (Product-market fit)
**Months 19-30**: Tier 4 (Growth phase)
**Years 3-5**: Tier 5 (Enterprise scale)
**Years 5+**: Tier 6 (Market leadership)

## Key Performance Indicators

- **Response Time**: <200ms for API calls
- **LLM Inference**: <2s for build generation
- **Screenshot Analysis**: <5s for complete analysis
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Database Performance**: <50ms query response time

## Conclusion

Scaling to 1 million users is achievable with the proposed React + Haskell + PostgreSQL + LLM architecture, but requires careful planning and significant investment. The key is to scale incrementally, validate assumptions at each tier, and maintain focus on core value proposition while managing technical complexity.

The total journey from 10 to 1M users represents a cost evolution from $29/month to $39,500/month, with the majority of costs driven by LLM inference and database scaling requirements.
